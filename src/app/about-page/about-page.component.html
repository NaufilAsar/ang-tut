    <p class="text-secondary about-para p-3">
      We are a small group of students from Government Polytechnic Mumbai who
      sought to overcome a problem as our Final Year Major Project which we
      faced in Online Shopping. We were given a task in the Course 'Computer
      Networks' to create a theoretical lab with Networking Setup for a budget
      of 1Lac for 10 PCs and their networking peripherals with them being of
      highest quality and as well as not over-budget. We found the task very
      easy but at the same time tedious to do so since different products were
      at different prices at different sites and of different qualities. Today
      majority of people prefer to buy-in products quickly from E-commerce
      giants such as Amazon and Flipkart who fluctuate prices for profit. This
      website was designed to provide customers with information about the
      products they wish to buy and also allowing them to find the best price
      for them across multiple sites. All free of cost.
